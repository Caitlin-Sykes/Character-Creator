A random project for all your video game character creator needs.

        - Electron 
        - HTML/CSS/JS (Maybe Typescript instead, will see)

        - NodeJS 
 
# Also uses:

    - Cait's decent JSON-writing skills

# To run: 
    - run npm run start, any neccessary packages will build automatically.
    - to make changes to the js, run "npm run watch" which will monitor the tailwind.
